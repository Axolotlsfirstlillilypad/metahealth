meta-analysis of health study


Our work is to  perform a meta-analysis on a healthcare studies, focusing on treatment outcomes and presenting the results in statistical tables.
To get our studies, we use the Google scholars API itself to scrape for studies with titles relating to healthcare. This we can then store in a csv dataset using the pandas to_dataset function. 

We will then use the csv with pandas and the meta library to perform the meta-analysis, before later printing our results. 

Overall the results point towards the data being supportive of the hypothesis, though obviously a limited number of studies cannot be conclusive.
